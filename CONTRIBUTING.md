Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!
Contributions are welcome, I'm very liberal accepting pull requests.

## New Stuff

If you are opening a pull request/issue/suggestion (*thanks!*), please include:

- a description of the fix/improvement
- test(s) that could prove that the sutff is working

## Running the tests

To make your life easier, you can get the _enqueuer docker developer image_.
Every broker/dependency is running perfectly over there.

To build:

  ```npm run build```

To run the test:
  
   ```npm tst```

Or, just:
  
  ```npm run all```

And get everything at the same time.
