# enqueuer
Event-driven-component testing tool.\
```There are many reasons why you should care about events; they drive autonomy, increase stability, help you move faster and allow for time travel, Jonas Bon√©r.```\
There is no doubt in how important events are, hence, test them becomes a high priority task. When developing an event-driven-architecture, it gets hard to keep track of how every component exchange messages with each other. Sometimes it occurs through message brokers, sometime it is a synchronous http post and sometimes it writes a file.\
In an event-driven world everything all events move asynchronously. As soon as we exit the boundary of a service, we enter a nondeterministic world. What **enqueuer** proposes to do is to give you confidence that a single component of your architecture acts like it should act when it was designed. It makes you be sure that, at least on the boundaries of this service, everything works as expected.
  
## what it does?
Checks whether an event-driven-component acts as expected.
By "acts as expected" we mean, the event-driven-component, when triggered by an event:
  - publishes where it is suppose to publish;
  - publishes what it is suppose to publish; and
  - publishes faster than the its timeout.
  
## why is it useful?
It is meant to help your development process.
Although there are other ways of using it, the two main ways are:
  - using it while you are developing a new feature of your component, in some kind of TDDish way; and
  - adding it to your testing pipeline, so you'll be asserting that the event-driven-component still behaves properly in every commit.

## how it works?
1. receives a [requisition](/examples/subscriptionAsStartEvent.enq.json "Requisition example") from some IPC mechanism defined in its [configuration](/conf/enqueuer.yml);
2. confirms the requisition reception;
	3. starts the requisition (publishing or waiting on an event);
	4. waits for events published by the event-driven-component;
    5. executes hook script upon these received events;
    6. reports back the [result](/output/outputReportExample.json).
    
### let me draw it for you
This is how your event-driven-conponent should act when triggered by an *Input*:\

What **enqueuer** does is to trigger *Input*, by itself, so the component-to-be-tested acts like it should. And then, **enqueuer** collects component-to-be-tested outputs and checks if they are what they are supposed to be.
Quite simple, don't you think?

When **enqueuer** receives a requisition, it starts an event described in the requisition and awaits untill all expecteds outputs are fulfilled or timed out. Once it happens, **enqueuer** gathers all it has and reports the result back through a mechanism described in the requisition.

### frequently asked question
Given that **enqueuer** is a tool that tests event-driven-components and it is an event-driven-component as well, does it test itself?
- I'm glad that you asked. As a matter of fact, yes, it does test itself, absolutely. [Check it out:](/src/inceptionTest/inception.test.ts "Inception Test")

###### IPC mechanisms currently supported are:
        standard input; standard output; files; UDS; http; amqp and mqtt.
