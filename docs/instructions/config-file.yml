#This file tells how enqueuer should be executed

#execution mode
#two modes are mutually exclusive 'single-run' and 'daemon'. At least one of them has to be defined
run-mode:
  # single-run mode: executes a single time. This is the one that has to be used when your goal is to integrate your pipeline.
  #             It runs, at the same time, every file (/docs/tests/test.yml) listed in 'files' field or that matches 'file' value.
  #             Once them all are ran, enqueuer ends its execution, compiles a summary and saves it in a file defined in 'reportName'.
  #             At the end of execution, a status code is returned:
  #               0, if everything is ok; or
  #               1, if there is at least one invalid thing.

  # daemon mode: it will run indefinitely. Endlessly. As a service.
  #         When running in daemon mode it will be waiting for test values (/docs/tests/test.yml) from those mechanisms inputs listed. One after the other.
  #         Every supported IPC protocol is available here and you can check their values in /docs/tests/subscriptions folder.

store:
  #Variables key and their value
  #Below, a 'tcpKey' key is defined with the value 'tcp value'.
  #there are two ways of using it:
  #   Non js code snippet: the easiest one is to type <<tcpKey>> where you want it to be replaced in a test file.
  #   js code snippet: simply store.tcpKey. So, if you type console.log(store.tcpKey) you'll see 'tcp value' being printed out in the console.
  tcpKey: "tcp value"

  #You can even define whole objects here:

    first: first value
    second:
      nested: thing
