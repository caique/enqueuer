#Every subscription has its own properties. But they all have properties defined in /docs/instructions/subscription.yml

#IPC protocol type. It has to be 'tcp-server'.
type: tcp-server

#TCP server port
#Ignored/Optional if a 'loadStream' field is set
port: 23075

#Optional. You know, once we open a socket stream sometimes we want to keep it open to keep sending/receiving messages.
#So, instead of opening it, you can load the same from a previous one saved with the same identifier set in 'saveStream' field.
#If this field is set, the field 'port' is ignored.
loadStream: nameToIdentifyTheStream

#Optional. You know, once we open a socket stream sometimes we want to keep it open to keep sending/receiving messages.
#So, instead of closing it, you can save it and open it later using the same identifier set in 'loadStream' field.
saveStream: nameToIdentifyTheStream

#Optional. Mock value that will be sent as response when this subscription receives a message
response: someValueHere

#Optional. Mock value that will be sent as soon as the tcp server got a connection
