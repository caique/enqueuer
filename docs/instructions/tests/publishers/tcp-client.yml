#Every publisher has its own properties. But they all have properties defined in /docs/publishers/publisher.yml

#IPC protocol type. It has to be 'tcp-client'.
type: tcp-client

#TCP server address
#Ignored/Optional if a 'loadStream' field is set
serverAddress: 127.0.0.1

#TCP server port
#Ignored/Optional if a 'loadStream' field is set
port: 23075

#Optional. You know, once we open a socket stream sometimes we want to keep it open to keep sending/receiving messages.
#So, instead of opening it again, you can load the same from a previous one saved with the same identifier set in 'saveStream' field.
#If this field is set, the fields 'serverAddress' and 'port' are ignored.
loadStream: nameToIdentifyTheStream

#Optional. You know, once we open a socket stream sometimes we want to keep it open to keep sending/receiving messages.
#So, instead of closing it again, you can save it and open it later using the same identifier set in 'loadStream' field.
saveStream: nameToIdentifyTheStream

#No invalid test will exist if this timeout expires. Even because there will be always a timeout set.

#Javascript code snippet executed as soon as the publisher receives a response.
#Available objects are: publisher (/docs/instructions/tests/publisher/amqp.yml), tester (/docs/instructions/tests/tester.d.ts), message and store.
