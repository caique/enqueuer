#Events are actions triggered by something.
#Currently, there are three events available:
#Variable replacements are available here. (/docs/instructions/variables.yml)

onInit: #Available in requisitions, publishers and subscriptions. It gets executed as soon as the field is initialized
onFinish: #Available in requisitions, publishers and subscriptions. It gets executed when the field is about to finish
onMessageReceived: #Available in subscriptions and in some synchronous publishers (http, kafka, tcp, uds etc.). It gets executed when the field receives a message.

#Every event object has 3 children:
#1 - script: Javascript code snippet executed when the event is triggered.

#2 - store: data to be persisted to be used in later requisitions/publishers/subscriptions
    #Optional. Javascript code snippet executed when the event is triggered.
    #Available objects are:
        #subscription (/docs/instructions/tests/subscriptions/subscription.yml) in a subscription field;
        #publisher (/docs/instructions/tests/publishers/publisher.yml) in a publisher field;
        #requisition (/docs/instructions/tests/requisitions.yml) in a requisition field;

#3 - assertions: array of assertions (/docs/instructions/tests/assertions.yml)

#--------
#Below, an onMessageReceived event is defined as an example.

onMessageReceived:
    script: |-
        message += 3;
        console.log(`Message received plus 3 is: ${message}`);

    store:
        message: message

      assertions:
        - name: anyValue #optional
          expect: message
          toBeEqualTo: store.key
        - expect: `abc`
          toBeEqualTo: `abc`
        - expectToBeDefined: message
